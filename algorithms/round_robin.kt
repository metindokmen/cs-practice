// The Round Robin algorithm is a load-balancing algorithm
// that distributes requests sequentially among a list of servers,
// cycling back to the first server once it reaches the last one.

// This approach ensures even distribution of traffic across all servers
// and is often used in scenarious like reverse-proxy load balancers
// where each server in a replica set receives rougly the same amount of traffic over time.
